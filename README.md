# MSTICPy Lab

This repo contains the code and data for an interactive lab in which to learn about [MSTICPy](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy).<br>
If you don't know anything about MSTICPy it is recommended that you start by reading [our documentation over at ReadTheDocs](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>

Once you understand what MSTICPy is you are ready to jump into the lab, the main component of which is a Jupyter Notebook. 

## What we will cover in the lab
In this lab you will learn about and use the main features of MSTICPy. The lab is split into several sections, each one focused on a key element of MSTICPy:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Enrichment
- Extracting Key Data
- Data Visualization
- Pivots in MSTICPy
- ML in MSTICPy

In each section you will have a set of guided examples that show you how the features works and how to call them. After the examples are short lab exercises for you to complete, these involve using the features you have just seen examples of. 
Don't worry if you can't complete any of the lab exercises, they are not required to move onto the next section. You can also view a completed version of the notebook [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy-lab/blob/main/MSTICPy_Lab_Completed.ipynb).

## How to use the lab
If you wish you can download this repo and run the notebook locally. However, a much easier experience is to click the 'Launch Binder' button below to launch the lab using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) this will load the notebook in a pre-configured environment that you can access straight from the browser without any setup required. The notebook contains all instructions and resources required for the lab.
